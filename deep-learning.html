                  Therefore, artificial intelligence includes machine learning

                  did not qualify as machine learning. quite a long time
                  Throughout the years, many experts have argued that

                  be achieved in the following way: Programmers, a set of clear

                <h2>Layer Types</h2>
                <p>
                  Deep learning models usually consist of many layers, and these
                  layers are designed to perform different tasks such as
                  representing data, learning features, and producing results.
                  Here are the common types of layers found in a typical deep
                  learning model:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <b>Input Layer:</b> This layer is external to the model.
                    receives data. Data is usually in the form of a vector or matrix
                    and the size of this layer depends on the data properties.
                  </li>

                    <b>Hidden Layers:</b>These layers
                    It is used to represent and learn properties. Deep
                    Learning models may have multiple hidden layers. This
                    layers, often using activation functions
                    modifies incoming signals and creates complex patterns
                    learns.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Fully Connected Layer:</b> This
                    The layer is connected to all units in the previous layer.
                    Each unit is connected to all units in the previous layer and
                    In this way, the learning capacity of the model increases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Activation Layers:</b>Activation
                    functions, outputs of units in hidden layers
                    are mathematical functions that determine. Sigmoid, ReLU
                    Functions such as (Rectified Linear Unit), tanh are frequently
                    An activation appropriate to the nature of the problem is used.
                    The most effective way to solve the problem is to use the function

                  <li>
                    <b>Pooling Layers:</b> Generally
                    reduce the size of feature maps and learn

                    Techniques such as max pooling and average pooling

                    The output depends on what it produces. For classification problems
                    like softmax, linear activation for regression problems
                    functions can be used.

                  Neural Networks are widely used to perform various tasks.
                  It has a wide application area. Image classification, language
                  in many areas such as processing, voice recognition and predictive analysis.
                  is used successfully. Deep learning, bigger and more
                  allows the use of complex Neural Networks, which
                  where more sophisticated features and tasks can be learned
                  It means.
